## Install and build dependencies

- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run start` to compile assets with watcher
- Run `npm run build` to compile the assets production ready

**Note: Once you finished development build and commit the files on `dist/` directory, this is configured to work with not hashes naming in order to import it on `AdminAssets.php` file**
